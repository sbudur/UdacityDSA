print ("Pass" if  (3 == sqrt(9)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (0 == sqrt(0)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (4 == sqrt(16)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (1 == sqrt(1)) else "Fail")

Complexity:
It works similar to binary search, here just we change the start and end accordingly in the function.
O(log(n))
